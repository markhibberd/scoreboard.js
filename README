Scoreboard-js is derived from the original swing based scoreboard [http://www.assembla.com/spaces/peeble/wiki]. 

This implementation is designed to complement, not replace, the swing version. Its primary
function is as a lightweight kickstart, demo or small devices (namely my phone, 
as I am too lazy to get to a real computer).

Kudos goes to Greg Davis for the original layout algorithm that is utilized by this
implementation.
