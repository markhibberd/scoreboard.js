= test

  . port all tests over - skeltons added for all the modules
  . roughly test suite is in boost
  . other scoreboard tests are in boardfu fork

= coverage

  . bit of an idea for js coverage, leverage html 5 local storage, dynamically instrument 
    and and add some pretty reports.

    this probably has a few legs.


= test runner

  . look at pulling out nic williams' js_autotest from newjs, or something similar


= build

  . cat & minify
  . package up to be embedded as a dependency in scoreboard-hudson plugin
  . push some static test pages to mth.io


= design

  . attempt to sort aqueduct control of async goodies
  . namespace up
